## Required Software Installations 
 
 - NodeJS required to start.

 -	To get started with Frisby.js, add it to your project as a dev dependency:
        
     `npm install  frisby --save-dev`
        
 -	Frisby.js uses Jasmine style assertion syntax, and uses Jest to run tests. Install it:
     
     `npm install  --save-dev jest`
 
 -	To run your tests, open a Terminal or console window, and type jest from the root folder of your project:
    
     `Jest`
 
 - If you need to do something custom like send requests through a **proxy**, you can also use fetch method directly 
   with custom options from the fetch spec.
